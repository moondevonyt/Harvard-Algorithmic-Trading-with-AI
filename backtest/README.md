# Backtesting

## Overview
Backtesting is a crucial component of the RBI (Research, Backtest, Implement) system. This process involves analyzing historical open, high, low, close, and volume data to evaluate if a trading strategy would have been successful in the past. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, strategies that worked historically have a higher probability of success going forward.

## Resources

### Template
- **template.py**: A starter template for backtesting that can be used with any trading idea. This is designed to work with strategies developed in the research phase. Simply examine the template and integrate your researched strategy to see how it would have performed historically.

### Backtesting Libraries
This repository includes support for three popular backtesting libraries:
1. **Backtesting.py**: Our recommended library and the one used in the template.py file. It offers a good balance of simplicity and power.
2. **Backtrader**: A comprehensive Python framework for backtesting and trading.
3. **Zipline**: An event-driven backtesting system developed by Quantopian.

### Data Acquisition
- **data.py**: A utility for obtaining market data from Yahoo Finance. Quality data is essential for effective backtesting - this module simplifies the process of acquiring the historical data needed to test your strategies.

## Getting Started
1. Review your trading idea from the research phase
2. Use data.py to gather historical market data
3. Modify template.py to implement your strategy
4. Run the backtest and analyze the results
5. Refine your strategy based on performance metrics
