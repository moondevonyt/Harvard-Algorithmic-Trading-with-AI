# Research: The Foundation of Algorithmic Trading

## Why Research Matters

Research is the critical first step in the RBI (Research, Backtest, Implement) system. Without proper research, you're essentially gambling rather than trading.

## Research Process Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow** - Begin with general strategy types, then focus on specific implementations
2. **Document Everything** - Keep detailed notes on every strategy idea and its source
3. **Evaluate Against Your Resources** - Consider data requirements, computational needs, and capital constraints
4. **Cross-Reference Multiple Sources** - Validate strategies across different books and papers
5. **Identify Key Assumptions** - Understand what market conditions each strategy requires
6. **Consider Risk First** - Evaluate potential drawdowns before potential returns
7. **Look for Counter-Arguments** - Seek out criticisms of strategies you're considering

## Finding Your Trading Style

Remember that the goal of research is to find strategies that match:
- Your personality and risk tolerance
- Your available capital
- Your technical capabilities
- Your time commitment

No strategy works forever, and what worked in the past doesn't always work in the future. The goal is to develop a deep understanding of market mechanics that allows you to adapt as conditions change.

## Next Steps

Once you have thoroughly researched multiple trading strategies, proceed to the Backtest (B) phase to validate your ideas with historical data.
